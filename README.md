# CRUD-with-python

In this project I have worked on CRUD operations using Python and SQLIT

Pre-requisite steps are:

- import sqlite3
- create connection to db
- create cursor from the connection to execute the query.

## Create Operation

- [ ] Step 1: Connect DB
- [ ] Step 2: Add Cursor
- [ ] Step 3: Create a function for Create Operation

[Go to Google](google.com) to learn more about CRUD operations.

## Read Operation

- Create a function for Selecting all data
